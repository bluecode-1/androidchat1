## Tips for Submitting Issues
To locate the problem as quickly as possible, you need to provide sufficient information. Please follow our required format when asking questions. ***If you do not follow the format, we will not be able to respond to your question***

#### Operation Instructions
Describe in detail which interface you operated on, every step should be explained in detail. If it's an SDK or API usage issue, you need to specify which function was called and what the parameters are.

#### Observed Behavior
Describe what happened, for example, the function returns an error, what is the error code, or what is the status on the interface, such as a red dot indicating message sending failure. Don't just say the feature has a problem or doesn't work.

#### Expected Result
What do you think the correct behavior should be.

#### Additional Conditions
Is it reproducible every time, or only occasionally? Does it only occur on specific networks/devices/platforms, or on all of them? Also, what version are you using, is it the latest version?

#### Demo Comparison Results
Please test with the demo and report what the status is on the demo.
